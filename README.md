Personal-Finance-Tracker
A simple command-line personal finance management application built with Java and Hibernate ORM. Track your income and expenses, set budget limits, and receive alerts when you exceed your spending goals.

The features are: Add income and expense records with categories and descriptions; Edit existing transactions by ID; Set monthly budget caps with overspending warnings; Input validation for safe data entry.

For this project I used a PostgreSQL database and Maven.
